# SSH

## Background

The [SSH (Secure Shell Protocol)](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/protocol) is a way of communicating with remote servers when logging in or transferring files. It provides secure connection by working like key-lock.
One of the most essential uses is to authenticate your account on public sites/servers. In this demo, you'll learn a straightforward way to create/utilize an SSH key for authentication based on
[the documentation from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh) on Linux. Details about other operating systems are found on GitHub.

## Where's my SSH key? 

On a Linux machine, the location of SSH keys is `~/.ssh`. Check whether you have any keys previously created through the command `cd ~/.ssh`. What kind of keys do you have? `ls` will show you a list of keys that are
currently present.

```
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
```

I see a pair of public (`id_rsa.pub`) and private (`id_rsa`) keys. The `cat` command shows what your keys look like:

```
# What does your public key look like?
$ cat id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHhPPIqNSZHUwUfNOPRNXquHqbKzZrppQsMGSy6V1PDo myemail@email.com
# What does your private key look like?
$ cat id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

qbKzZrppQsMGSy6V1PDoAAAAFnlvdXJfZW1haWxAZXhhbXBsZS5jb20BAgMEBQYH
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

You have a long string consisting of upper and lower letters, which is referred to as a _fingerprint_. Why are they a pair? Think of them as a physical key and a lock. Your private key (e.g. `id_rsa`) is like your personal 
house key. It must be kept secret and stored securely on your local machine, accessible only by you. In contrast, your public key (e.g. `id_rsa.pub`) is like a lock. You can place this lock on any remove service you 
want to access, such as [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or [NIH HPC](https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/sshkeys.html). When you connect,
The service uses your public key (the lock) to verify your private key (the key) for authentication.

How do I create a pair of SSH keys?

## Creating a new SSH key

The command `ssh-keygen` is used to create SSH keys. Explore the command via `ssh-keygen --help`.

```
$ ssh-keygen --help
unknown option -- -
usage: ssh-keygen [-q] [-b bits] [-t dsa | ecdsa | ed25519 | rsa | rsa1]
                  [-N new_passphrase] [-C comment] [-f output_keyfile]
ssh-keygen -p [-P old_passphrase] [-N new_passphrase] [-f keyfile]
ssh-keygen -i [-m key_format] [-f input_keyfile]
ssh-keygen -e [-m key_format] [-f input_keyfile]
ssh-keygen -y [-f input_keyfile]
ssh-keygen -c [-P passphrase] [-C comment] [-f keyfile]
ssh-keygen -l [-v] [-E fingerprint_hash] [-f input_keyfile]
ssh-keygen -B [-f input_keyfile]
ssh-keygen -D pkcs11
ssh-keygen -F hostname [-f known_hosts_file] [-l]
ssh-keygen -H [-f known_hosts_file]
ssh-keygen -R hostname [-f known_hosts_file]
ssh-keygen -r hostname [-f input_keyfile] [-g]
ssh-keygen -G output_file [-v] [-b bits] [-M memory] [-S start_point]
ssh-keygen -T output_file -f input_file [-v] [-a rounds] [-J num_lines]
          [-j start_line] [-K checkpt] [-W generator]
ssh-keygen -s ca_key -I certificate_identity [-h] [-n principals]
          [-O option] [-V validity_interval] [-z serial_number] file ...
ssh-keygen -L [-f input_keyfile]
ssh-keygen -A
ssh-keygen -k -f krl_file [-u] [-s ca_public] [-z version_number]
          file ...
ssh-keygen -Q -f krl_file file ...
```

The `-t` flag is used to configure the type of SSH key. There are 5 different key options available: `[-t dsa | ecdsa | ed25519 | rsa | rsa1]`. However, your SSH client may limit the available options.

Let's create your SSH key by following the [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key). Assume
you're still in `~/.ssh`.

```
~/.ssh$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

Running this command returns further options below:

```
enerating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519):   # <Press enter to skip>
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):                          # <Optional. Enter to skip>
Enter same passphrase again:                                         # <Optional. Enter to skip>
```
